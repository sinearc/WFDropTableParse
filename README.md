# WFDropTableParse

## Welcome to the shitshow

The goal here is to create a collection of functions able to consistently parse the WARFRAME public drop tables, loaded as an html DOM, and store the data in a usable serialized form

For the same reason, expect a significant delay in the execution of any of these functions
The table can be found at:
